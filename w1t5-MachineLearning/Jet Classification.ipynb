For that please follow the instructions in the official [repository](https://github.com/erum-data-idt/pd4ml/blob/main/examples/1_top_plots.ipynb) of `pd4ml`. In the tutorial below we are using a smaller version of it with ~100k events instead of ~2M. we are going to use a small version of it. In our case, instead of having ~2M events we only have ~100k."
