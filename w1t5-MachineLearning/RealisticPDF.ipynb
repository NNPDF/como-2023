    "# Real life PDF fit\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial (PDF Fitting) we have fitted a Neural Network to PDF data that we have obtained from LHAPDF. Ah! If life were so simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "Reality is much more complicated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We cannot measure the PDF: we have no PDF data!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The data has some uncertainties associated to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to do a more realistic (albeit simplified) PDF fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From the PDF to the experimental data\n",
    "\n",
    "In an experiment we only have access to observables. These observables, while they can be computed theoretically, depend on the PDF in a non trivial manner, for hadronic collision (such as those at the LHC) we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathcal{O} = \\displaystyle\\sum_{ij} \\int dx_{1} dx_{2}  \\  f_{i}  (x_1, \\mu_F) \\  f_{j}(x_2, \\mu_F) \\ \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\mu_{R}, \\mu_{F})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity (and because that topic was already covered in the tutorials of the third day) we are going to drop the dependence on $\\mu_F$ from the PDF. All scale-dependence is contained in the partonic cross section instead\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing the model of the PDF that we built in the previous tutorial our PDF have instead the following form: $f_{i}(x) = (1 - x)^{1+\\beta}NN_{i}(x)$ where the index $i$ refers to the parton.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathcal{O} = \\displaystyle\\sum_{ij} \\int dx_{1} dx_{2}  \\ (1 - x_1)^{1+\\beta}NN_{i}(x_1) \\ (1 - x_2)^{1+\\beta}NN_{j}(x_2) \\ \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\mu_{R}, \\mu_{F})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the previous equation both Neural Networks are the same, but are evaluated at different values of $x$ (and potentially contribute with different partons $i$ and $j$). This means the observable depends non-linearly on the Neural Network, which greatly complicates the training. For this tutorial we are going to limit ourselves to DIS observables so one of the two PDFs is set to 1, which will facilitate the construction of the network, but in a global PDF fit both DIS and double-hadronic observables need to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point we have used Mean Squared Errors as the loss function to be optimized. In this case we are comparing datapoints ($D$) with observables ($\\mathcal{O}$). The loss function thus looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    L = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k} (\\mathcal{O}_{k} - D_{k})^2 = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k}\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{ij} \\int dx_{1} dx_{2}  \\ (1 - x_1)^{1+\\beta}NN_{i}(x_1) \\ (1 - x_2)^{1+\\beta}NN_{j}(x_2) \\ \\hat{\\sigma}_{ij}^{(k)}(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\mu_{R}, \\mu_{F}) - D_{k}\\right)^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "with $k$ running over datapoints in the fit. This loss function corresponds and it is usually called $\\chi^{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the previous consideration, we need to include the information about the experimental uncertainties. Experimental uncertainties introduce correlations between datapoints which need to be taken into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    L = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k,l} (\\mathcal{O}_{k} - D_{k})s_{kl}^{-1}(\\mathcal{O}_{l} - D_{l})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "With $s_{kl}^{-1}$ the inverse of the covariance matrix. In the limit of a diagional covariance matrix (no correlation between datapoints) one would recover the simpler form that we have used before.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial outline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to take the final multi-flavour PDF we constructed in the previous one as the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have a realistic-looking PDF from only a few datasets, we are going to use the `.npz` files that you downloaded in the first day of the school. They contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `D`: the experimental data\n",
    "- `covmat`: the experimetal covariance matrix\n",
    "- `fktable`: an interpolation table for the partonic cross section the fktable is a tensor `(ndata, luminosity channel, x)`\n",
    "- `xgrid`: grid in x in which to evaluate the PDF\n",
    "- `luminosity`: the relevant indices of the luminosity\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we will do is to create an observable that we can compare to data. In a first step we will simply compare to data without taking into account the experimental uncertainties. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will create a custom loss function, introducing the covariance matrix into the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will finish the tutorials creating replicas of the data to generate a PDF ensemble."
